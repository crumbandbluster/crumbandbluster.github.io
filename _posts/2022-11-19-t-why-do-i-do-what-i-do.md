title: "about the blog, or: why do i do what i do?"

I started this blog for a variety or reasons which I won't really get into because they aren't that interesting.
But suffice to say, I decided to start a blog before I had decided what I was going to blog about!
I listen to a lot of music.  My 2021 Spotify&trade; wrapped had me spending something like 17% of the total hours in the year listening to spotify.
Particularly I like to listen to *new* (to me) music and keep a large playlist every year of all the music I heard for the first time that tickled my fantsy.
So I figured, why not write about some of the songs I find, and particularly enjoy.
I have no formal trainig in music, in playing or criticism, and I don't spend a lot of time reading about music either.
All this to say, I don't really know how to write about music, so this might be tough going for you, dear reader.


I mostly find new music through 3 sources.  
First, I make good use of Spotify&trade;'s music discovery feature.  
This certainly has it's problems, which I'll expand about on a later post, but I've found some music I truly love this way.
Second, I listen to the radio.  
I primarily listen to [WFMU](https://wfmu.org/), which I've been listening to since I was a kid in New Jersey.
Recently i've started listening to [radio 614](https://radio614.org/), internet radio out of Columbus, Ohio.
Lastly, friends send me excellent tunes from time to time.
I hope to spend more time reading other music blogs in the future, both for music discovery, and to improve my own writing.

So that's it!  Enjoy, if you can.
