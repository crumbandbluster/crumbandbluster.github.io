I'm in the slightly awkward position of wanting to write about music but not knowing how.  First and foremost, I completely lack the vocabulary.  The solution is pretty obvious, I need to *read* about music, probably something that I should have done before I even started this endeavor.  I'll try to do that more regularly, and if you have any suggestions of music publications, send them my way.
Still, I'll stop twiddling my thumbs and get started.  Please bear with me as I struggle to find the words and speak cogently

# Benjamin Clementine - By the Ports of Europe (2017)
Lets start things off with the song "By the Ports of Europe" by Benjamin Clementine off his 2017 album, *I Tell a Fly*.  This is the first and so far only song I've heard by Clementine so I don't know how characteristic it is of his style, but I was instantly hooked.
This is a fun song with a nice beat that does a great job highlighting Clementine's rich voice and great range.  
With lyrics rich with animal poetry and heavy repetition of the phrase "the ports of Europe" this song doesn't so much tell you anything in particular as conjure images of a timeless, countryless port city.  This sprung pretty easily from the bank of drawings and images that have marinated in my mind from various sources, but the city from *Kiki's Delivery Service* came to my mind most particularly.  But hey, I'm susceptible, there's only so many times you can say "port" (something like 81 if genius.com is to believed) before my mind goes there.  I love a port city so I'm certainly not complaining.

As said above, Clementine has a remarkable voice and you hear a lot of it on this song.  
He takes his voice all of over the place in tones I don't have the words to describe, with what feel like warbles, whoops, and screeches, making the repetitive refrains anything but boring. The harpsichord that comes in during the second half of the song (a switch from the classic piano/voice pair of the beginning) adds to the baroque feel, and reminds me of some of my favorite Richard Harris songs.  Mostly though, I'm reminded of Rufus Wainwright.
This man can bellow out beauty and his power and artistry is clear in the way his voice rises and falls with the verses.  I wish I knew enough about vocal performance to describe what he's doing, but he's fantastic at it.  If you're a fan of the tenor singer songwriter, and baroque pop, check this out without delay.
